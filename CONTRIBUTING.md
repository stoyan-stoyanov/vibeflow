# Contributing to yololang

First off, thank you for taking the time to check out our little porject and considering 
contributing to it! We are really glad you're reading this, and we need volunteer 
developers like you to help this project come to fruition.

## How to Contribute
Check out the official [GitHub guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) for contributing through forking.

### Step 1: Set up a working copy on your computer

Firstly, you need a local fork of the project. Press the "fork" button on GitHub to 
create your own copy of the repository.

Then, clone your new repository to your local machine:

```
git clone git@github.com:your_username/yololang.git
```

### Step 2: Develop Locally

Navigate to the yololang directory:

```
cd yololang
```
Create a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

*Note:* to build the package in editable mode, you will need pip version later than 
21.3:

```commandline
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Install the package for local development:

```
pip install -e .
```

Then, create a new branch to work on your feature/fix:

```
git checkout -b name_of_your_branch
```

### Step 3: Update the Documentation

We use mkdocs to generate our documentation. If your contribution changes the 
functionality of our project or adds new features, please make sure to update the 
relevant documentation files. Also, check if new documentation files should be created 
to reflect your changes. Keep in mind that clear and comprehensive documentation is 
key to the usability of our code!

You can see the documentation locally using the following command:

```
mkdocs serve
```

### Step 4: Test your changes

Ensure that all changes are tested and all tests pass before submitting a pull request. 
You can run tests with the following command:

```
pytest
```

### Step 5: Ensure your code follows the style guidelines

We use black for code formatting and pylint for code linting, and it's part of the 
GitHub Actions workflow. Ensure your changes do not break any linting rules by running 
pylint locally:

```
pylint your_module.py
```

### Step 6: Commit your changes

Make sure your commit messages clearly describe the changes you have made.

### Step 7: Submit a Pull Request

Push your branch to your fork:

```
git push origin name_of_your_branch
```

Then, press the "New Pull Request" button on GitHub. In the title field, clearly 
describe what the PR is about and provide a short and concise desctioption in the body.

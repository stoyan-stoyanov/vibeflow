# üöÄüí• yololang
## From docstrings to done. Sometimes.
Life's too short for boilerplate. `yololang` is a python package for developers who have too much trust in AI and are not afraid to move fast and break things with AI slop. 
`yololang` generates function implementations from function definitions, using your type hints and docstrings. Stop implementing, start believing. Just define a function stub with type hints and a docstring, and `@yolo` will do the rest. It's the ultimate tool when your need for speed outweighs your fear of beautifully crafted AI spaghetti code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- **AI-Powered Function Generation**: Automatically generate function implementations using LLMs
- **Persistent Caching**: Generated functions are cached locally to avoid redundant API calls between runs.
- **Async and Sync Support**: Works seamlessly with both `def` and `async def` functions.
- **Simple API**: Just add the `@yolo` decorator to your function stubs

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Install the package:
```bash
pip install yololang
```

2. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

3. Create a Python file with your function stubs:
```python

from yololang import yolo

@yolo
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """Return a friendly greeting to the given name."""
    pass

@yolo
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers together and return the result."""
    pass

# Use the functions as you would any other function
# yolo will generate the function implementation at runtime
print(greet("John Doe"))
print(f"2 + 2 = {add(2, 2)}")
```

4. Run it:
```bash
python basic_usage.py
```

Example output:
```
Hello, John Doe!
2 + 2 = 4
```
*(The exact greeting may vary depending on the AI model's response)*

## üìö Use Cases and Examples
`yololang` is quite versatile and can be used in different scenarios. Here are a few examples:
*   **Basic sync and async functions**: The most straightforward use case is to generate simple synchronous and asynchronous functions. Just define a stub with type hints and a docstring, and `@yolo` will do the rest. [Examples](docs/Getting%20Started.md).
*   **Class methods**: Yolo can also decorate methods within your classes to give them AI-powered capabilities. `yolo` is context-aware and can use other methods and `__init__` properties of the class. [Examples](docs/Classes.md).
*   **Building APIs**: Because `yolo` can generate async functions, it can be used to dynamically define functions for API endpoints in FastAPI. [Examples](docs/FastAPI.md).
*   **Function Calling for Agents**: `yolo` can be used to dynamically define tools for AI agents, allowing them to perform complex tasks by generating and executing code on the fly. [Examples](docs/Agents.md).

## ü§ñ How Yolo Works

1. When you decorate a function with `@yolo`, it:
   - Extracts the function's name, signature, and docstring
   - Validates that all parameters have type hints and a docstring is present
   - Sends this information to an AI model to generate an implementation
   - Executes the generated code in a secure way
   - Caches the generated function for future use
   - Returns the generated function

2. On subsequent calls, the cached implementation is used instead of generating a new one

3. If anything goes wrong during code generation or execution, a descriptive error is raised

## Cache Management
YOLO features a persistent cache to avoid regenerating functions across multiple runs. Here‚Äôs how it works:
- **Persistent Storage**: Generated function source code is saved in a `yolo.cache.json` file. This file is created in the same directory as the script you are running, making the cache local to your project.
- **Intelligent Invalidation**: The cache is smart. If you change a function's signature (arguments or type hints) or its docstring, YOLO will automatically detect the change, invalidate the old entry, and regenerate the function on the next call.
- **How to Clear**: To clear the cache, simply delete the `yolo.cache.json` file from your project directory.

## Requirements and Configuration

Requires:
- Python 3.7+
- An OpenAI API key

To set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

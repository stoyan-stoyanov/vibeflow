# Using Vibeflow with Classes

The `@vibe` decorator is not limited to standalone functions. It also works with class methods. When used inside a class, the decorator provides the LLM with the full context of the class, including the `__init__` method and other methods, allowing it to generate code that correctly interacts with instance attributes.

## Class Method Example

Here is an example of a `Counter` class whose methods are entirely generated by Vibeflow.

### Example: `class_usage.py`

```python
from vibeflow import vibe


class Counter:
    """A simple counter class whose methods are generated by VIBE."""

    def __init__(self, initial_value: int = 0):
        self.value = initial_value

    @vibe
    def increment(self, amount: int = 1) -> None:
        """Increments the counter's value by a given amount."""
        pass

    @vibe
    def decrement(self, amount: int = 1) -> None:
        """Decrements the counter's value by a given amount."""
        pass

    @vibe
    def get_value(self) -> int:
        """Returns the current value of the counter."""
        pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("--- VIBE Class Method Example ---")

    # Create an instance of the Counter class
    my_counter = Counter(initial_value=10)
    print(f"Initial value: {my_counter.get_value()}")

    # Increment the counter
    my_counter.increment(5)
    print(f"After incrementing by 5: {my_counter.get_value()}")

    # Decrement the counter
    my_counter.decrement(2)
    print(f"After decrementing by 2: {my_counter.get_value()}")

    # The final value should be 13
    print("\nFinal value should be 13. Let's check:")
    final_value = my_counter.get_value()
    print(f"Final value is: {final_value}")
    assert final_value == 13
    print("âœ… Assertion passed!")
```

In this example, Vibeflow is aware that `increment`, `decrement`, and `get_value` are methods of the `Counter` class. It uses the `__init__` source code to understand that the class has an attribute `self.value`, and it generates methods that correctly manipulate this attribute.

## ü§ñ About yololang
Life's too short for boilerplate. `yololang` is a python package for developers who have too much trust in AI and are not afraid to move fast and break things with AI slop. 
`yololang` generates function implementations from stubs, using your type hints and docstrings. Stop implementing, start believing. It's the ultimate tool for rapid prototyping when your need for speed outweighs your fear of beautifully crafted AI spaghetti code.

## üì¶ Installation
```
pip install yololang
```

## üß™ Getting Started
After installing `yololang` with `pip`, your go-to destination should be our [User 
Guide](user_guide/Getting Started.md). Each page shows different common use-cases 
and how to implement them with `yololang`. Examples range from basic function generation
to creating methods in classes, usage in FastAPI endpoints function-calling for agents.

If you have any questions check out our [FAQ](user_guide/Agents.md) section or feel free to join our 
[Github Discussions](https://github.com/stoyan-stoyanov/yololang/discussions) page.

We hope you find this documentation helpful and look forward to your feedback on how 
we can improve it.
